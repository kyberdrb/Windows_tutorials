METHOD 1: Using Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc)

1. Press "WIN+R" key combination to launch RUN dialog box then type gpedit.msc and press Enter. It'll open Group Policy Editor.

2. Now go to:

    Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Control Panel -> Personalization

3. In right-side pane, double-click on "Do not display the lock screen" option and set its value to "Enabled".

That's it. It'll immediately disable lock screen in Windows 8. If you want to enable lock screen again, set the value to Not configured.



METHOD 2: Using Registry Editor (regedit)

If you don't want to use Group Policy Editor or can't use it, you can do the same thing using Registry Editor. Just follow these simple steps:

1. Press "WIN+R" key combination to launch RUN dialog box then type regedit and press Enter. It'll open Registry Editor.

2. Now go to following key:

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Personalization

If the above key doesn't exist, you'll need to create it manually.

3. Select Personalization key and in right-side pane, create a new DWORD NoLockScreen and set its value to 1

4. Close Registry Editor and log off or restart Windows to take effect. It'll completely turn off lock screen.

If you want to restore lock screen in future, just delete the DWORD or set its value to 0.
