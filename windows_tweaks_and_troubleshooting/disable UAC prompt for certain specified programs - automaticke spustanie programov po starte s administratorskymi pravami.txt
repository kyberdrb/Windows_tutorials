The process is a little tedious, but easy enough if you're familiar with Task Scheduler:P

1. In Task Scheduler, right-click "Task Scheduler Library" and select "New Folder" Name it whatever you would like.
2. Select the new folder and click "Create Task" (not "Create Basic Task")
3. Name the task something descriptive. Enable "Run with highest privileges," and select your OS under "Configure for."
4. Under the Actions tab, select "Start a program" in the Action dropdown if it isn't already. Click Browse and find your app's .exe file (usually under Program Files on your C: drive).
5. (Laptops) Under Conditions tab, deselect "Start the task only if the computer is on AC power."
6. On your desktop, right click and select New > Shortcut.
7. Paste    C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe /RUN /TN "Name of folder\Name of task" into the text box.
for example C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe /RUN /TN "Custom Rules\ALLBrowsersMemory(NoUACPrompt)"
