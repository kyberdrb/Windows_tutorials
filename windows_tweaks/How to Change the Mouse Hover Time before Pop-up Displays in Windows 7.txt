Note: Right click on Computer -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Advanced -> Performance -> Untick Animations in the taskbar and start menu otherwise the difference will be minimal

1. Open the Start Menu, then type regedit in the search box and press Enter.

2. If prompted by UAC, then click on Yes.

3. In regedit, navigate to the location below:

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Mouse

4. In the right pane, right click MouseHoverTime and click on Modify.

5. Type in a number between 0 to 4000 (400 is default, I use 30) for how many milliseconds, and click on OK. (See screenshot below)
NOTE: The lower the number, the faster the response time. If you use an entry of 0, there is no delay before the tooltip opens.

6. Close regedit.

7. Log off and log on, or restart the computer to apply the changes.
NOTE: As a test, hover the mouse pointer over a tooltip or Start Menu All Programs and see how much faster it opens.
